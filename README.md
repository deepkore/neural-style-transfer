# Neural Style Transfer  
Stylize your images with AI  

## Overview  
This project utilizes a **Neural Style Transfer** model to transform your images by applying artistic styles. The model is deployed using **Streamlit**, providing an easy-to-use interface for users to upload and stylize their images effortlessly.  

## Live Demo  
üîó **[Neural Style Transfer App](https://neural-style-transfer-bcxencwluibwkzbak82gtj.streamlit.app/)**  

üìå **Note:** Since the app is hosted on **Streamlit's free cloud**, it may enter sleep mode when inactive. Simply restart the app if necessary.  

## How to Use  
1. Click on the **app link** above.  
2. Upload an image from your device.  
3. Choose a style to apply.  
4. Generate and download your stylized image.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Neural Style Transfer (NST)**  
- **Python**  
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch**  
- **Streamlit (for UI & deployment)**
